CRUD_Flask is a basic web application built using the Flask framework in Python to demonstrate CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—on a data model. It serves as an introductory-level project for understanding how to build web apps with Flask, connect to a database, and deploy applications to the cloud.

The application allows users to perform standard database operations via a web interface, making it an ideal starting point for learning backend development and full-stack integration.
